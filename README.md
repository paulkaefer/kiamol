## Paul's **KIAMOL** repo

Tracks my code and [notes](/notes.md) working through the book **Learn Kubernetes in a Month of Lunches**.

See [the official book repo](https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol) for resources.

## TODO
- [ ] rename this to just paulkaefer/kiamol?
- [ ] join the forum (see p. xviii) & link it here
